# ClinicManagement :
- Due the COVID-19 pandemic , we have all seen the troubles one has to go through when they have to physically visit a doctor. This project's main focus is to take that into light 	and come out with a solution for the same. <br>
- Through this project , we had aimed to make an online hospital/pharmacy interface that makes it a hassle-free process to visit the doctor and get a diagnosis. <br>
- We also have a pharmacy feature to immediately check the availability of medicines as prescribed the doctor. <br>
- We also have a feature where the patient can view his/her record and diagnosis which makes it easier for them to view the same from their house i.e , they don't have to go visit 	the doctor for the same. <br>
